# ice-cream-cow

Very simple and slightly surreal pygame zero game.

Based on code from the more coherent [https://github.com/williamhbell/PygameZero](https://github.com/williamhbell/PygameZero)

Use the left and right arrows to move the penguin across the screen to deliver some ice-cream to the cow, causing it to moo happily.  If the penguin is hit by one of the randomly-flying beach balls it will explode loudly. Penguin will jump if you hit space, though this doesn't really help much.
