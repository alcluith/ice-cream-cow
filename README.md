# ice-cream-cow

Very simple and slightly surreal pygame zero game to try out the functions
Based on code from the more coherent https://github.com/williamhbell/PygameZero

Use the left and right arrows to move the penguin across the screen to deliver some ice-cream to the cow, causing it to moo happily.  
If the penguin is hit by one of the randomly-flying beach balls it will explode loudly.
